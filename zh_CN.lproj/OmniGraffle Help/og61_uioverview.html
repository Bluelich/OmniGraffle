		<div>The CanvasIn the middle of the interface is the Canvas, which is where you do all of your drawing. You can use the drawing tools to create shapes, connect them with lines, drag and group objects, create tables, and do way more stuff than we can mention here in this quick list of features.
</div>
		<div>The InspectorsWith OmniGraffle 6.1, we’ve brought back floating inspector palettes! We’ve combined the Inspectors and the Stencil Library into an ultra-handy Inspectors sidebar to the right of the canvas, and you can use the new Inspectors menu to choose between an Inspector sidebar, a floating inspector window, or to have individual palettes for each inspector.
</div>
		<div>The SidebarThe sidebar combines the Canvases and Outline sidebars from OmniGraffle 5 into a single sidebar with Canvases at the top and the Contents viewer below. You can resize these panes to suit your needs, and the benefit for you is more space within the Canvas so you can focus on your work.</div>
		<div>The ToolbarThe toolbar provides easy access to the controls of your choosing. Choose View ▸ Customize Toolbar (or Control-click) on the toolbar to arrange your favorite tools. Most importantly, the toolbar is home to the Tool Palette which you’ll use to create diagrams and such. To hide or show the toolbar, choose View ▸ Hide Toolbar or View ▸ Show Toolbar, respectively.</div>
		<div>The Style TrayWhenever you apply a style—a fill color, border, shadow, and so on—that information shows up in little chits in the Style Tray just beneath the Inspectors. Need to apply the style from one object to another? Select the styled object and grab its master chit (the one on the left) and drag it to the object that needs styling.
