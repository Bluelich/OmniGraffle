<h1 id="gettingtoknowomnigraffle">Getting to Know OmniGraffle</h1>

<p>Sure, it&#8217;s still the same great chart-drawing, prototyping, wireframing app you&#8217;ve grown to love and adore, but we&#8217;ve pulled out the stops with OmniGraffle 6.1. The biggest change you&#8217;ll notice is a new unified user interface. Take some time to mouse over the following image to learn more about OmniGraffle&#8217;s user interface.
</p>

	<div id="og61uioverview_hype_container" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:700px;height:600px;">
		<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="og61_uioverview.hyperesources/og61uioverview_hype_generated_script.js?79869"></script>
	</div>

<p>
By default, the Inspectors appear in a sidebar to the right of the Canvas. You&#8217;ll be happy to know that we have brought back the floating Inspectors with OmniGraffle 6.1! You can use the new <strong>Inspectors</strong> menu to choose to have all of the inspectors in one floating window, or choose to have them appear as individual floating palettes.</p>

<p>Now that you have a better understanding of how OmniGraffle is organized visually, let&#8217;s dive in deeper and look at everything OmniGraffle has to offer. If you haven&#8217;t launched OmniGraffle yet, now might be a good time to do that.</p>

<h2 id="rulersandtheinspectorbar">Rulers and the Inspector Bar</h2>

<p>In addition to the grid, which you can turn on in the <strong>Grid</strong> Canvas inspector (<strong>Command&#8211;4</strong>), you can also turn on rulers (<strong>View &#x25b8; Rulers</strong>, or <strong>Command-R</strong>) to help you position objects on the canvas.</p>

<p>You can use a combination of ruler guides and OmniGraffle&#8217;s Smart Guides to position and perfectly align objects on the canvas. To add a ruler guide to your canvas, click and hold on either the top or left ruler bar and then drag a guide onto the canvas. The guides you drag in are bright pink, so they are easy to recognize. There&#8217;s no limit to the number of guides you can drag onto the canvas, so don&#8217;t be shy.</p>

<p><img src="HelpImages/og61_ruleroriginpoint.png" alt="The origin point can be dragged out to any other position on the canvas" id="og61_ruleroriginpoint" style="width:200px;" class="floatR" />By default, the very upper-left corner of a canvas is known as its <em>origin</em> (that is, the point from which all ruler measurements originate, and the coordinates are 0,0). To change the origin, click and drag the origin from the corner where the rulers meet. (Alternatively, you can enter <strong>Origin</strong> values in the <strong>Units</strong> Canvas inspector.) The coordinates in the Geometry inspector are based on this origin point.</p>

<p>To reset the origin to the 0,0 position, just click on the origin point between the two rulers. Click the origin point again and the origin point changes to its previous position.</p>

<p>When you have selected an object, the area above the ruler&#8212;the <strong>Inspector Bar</strong>&#8212;contains controls for editing basic attributes of selected objects:</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_rulersandinspectorbar_01.png" alt="Rulers and Inspector bar" id="og61_rulersandinspectorbar_01" style="width:700px;" />
</figure>

<ol>
<li><strong>Horizontal Object Position</strong>&#8212;the object&#8217;s position from the left origin point.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Object Position</strong>&#8212;the object&#8217;s position from the top origin point.</li>
<li><strong>Object Width</strong>&#8212;the object&#8217;s width.</li>
<li><strong>Object Height</strong>&#8212;the object&#8217;s height.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Casting Style</strong>&#8212;set the shadow style for the object; for additional control over shadows, see the Shadow inspector.</li>
<li><strong>Shape Style</strong>&#8212;this pop-up lets you quickly select a shape style for the selected object.</li>
<li><strong>Stroke</strong>&#8212;choose a stroke style for the selected object.</li>
<li><strong>Stroke Color</strong>&#8212;set a color for the object&#8217;s stroke.</li>
<li><strong>Stroke Thickness</strong>&#8212;set the width (or thickness) for a stroke.</li>
<li><strong>Fill Type</strong>&#8212;choose a fill type for the selected object(s). Use the controls to the right to set the fill color (or colors, if you have selected one of the gradient options).</li>
</ol>

<p>When entering or editing text you&#8217;ve placed on the Canvas, tab stops appear in the top ruler and text formatting controls appear in the Inspector Bar. You can style text, change the spacing and alignment, or drag tab stops to and from the ruler.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_rulersandinspectorbar_02.png" alt="The Inspector bar with text controls" id="og61_rulersandinspectorbar_02" style="width:700px;" />
</figure>

<h2 id="usingthestyletray">Using the Style Tray</h2>

<p>At the bottom of the Inspector sidebar, you&#8217;ll find a tray which contains style &#8220;chits&#8221; for the selected object.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_styletray.png" alt="The Style Tray" id="og61_styletray" style="width:250px;" />
</figure>

<p>The isolated chit on the left represents all of the styles applied to the selected object, while the rest of the chits represent each of the styles applied to the object, such as fill, stroke, image, shadow, shape, font, and text position. Drag any of these chits to another object, to a group in the Selection inspector, or to a tool in the tool palette, to copy the style there.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-glyph"></span><strong>Note</strong><br/>
The absence of a style&#8212;such as having no stroke, no fill, or no shadow&#8212;also counts as a style. For instance, you can drag a &#8220;no fill&#8221; chit to an object to remove its fill.</p>
</div>

<p>If you select more than one object, only the styles that those objects have in common appear in the style tray.</p>

<h2 id="preferences">Setting OmniGraffle&#8217;s Preferences</h2>

<p>A standard feature among Mac apps, OmniGraffle&#8217;s preferences can be accessed from the menu bar (<strong>OmniGraffle &#x25b8; Preferences</strong>), or with the <strong>Command-,</strong> keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p>Two features that all of the preference panes offer are the ability to <strong>Reset</strong> (<img src="HelpImages/og61_button_reset.png" alt="The Reset button" id="og61_button_reset" style="width:60px;" />) any changes you&#8217;ve made to the defaults settings, and quick access to <strong>Help</strong> (<img src="HelpImages/og61_button_help.png" alt="The Help button" id="og61_button_help" style="width:18px;" />) documentation for that pane.</p>

<h3 id="generalpreferences">General Preferences</h3>

<p>The General preferences give you control over basic OmniGraffle settings, such as what OmniGraffle does at startup, whether new documents open with a blank canvas or you&#8217;re taken to the template chooser, and things like text editing and selection behaviors. You can also turn on <strong>Multi-Touch</strong> for trackpad support, and opt for OmniGraffle to only show you the inspectors you need when you&#8217;re working on the canvas.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_prefs_general.png" alt="OmniGraffles General preference pane" id="og61_prefs_general" style="width:500px;" />
</figure>

<p>Options include:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Startup</dt>
<dd>Select Create new document if nothing else is open to start with a new document when you aren&#8217;t making OmniGraffle remember open documents, or if there were no open documents the last time you quit.</dd>

<dt>New Documents</dt>
<dd>Select Open Resource Browser to be presented with a window for choosing from a variety of file sources each time you create a new document. Select Use Template, and choose your default template, if you&#8217;d rather bypass the browser. Either way, you can always get to the browser with the Resource Browser command in the File menu.</dd>

<dt>Text Editing</dt>
<dd>Decide how you would like the Return and Tab keys to behave while you are editing an object&#8217;s text. Whichever way you choose, you can hold Option while pressing the key to do the reverse instead.</dd>

<dt>Selection</dt>
<dd>Small objects get smaller versions of the handles that appear when you select them; if you really like the small ones, you can click Always use small selection handles to see them all the time.</dd>

<dd>
<p>When you click in the middle of a shape object that isn&#8217;t filled with an image or color, you might want to select the object or you might want to select whatever is behind it. Use the Click through objects with no fill checkbox to indicate which you prefer.</p></dd>

<dt>Multi-Touch</dt>
<dd>Disabled by default, turn this option on if you&#8217;d like to use Multi-Touch gestures with a trackpad on a compatible MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or other device.</dd>

<dt>Help Tags</dt>
<dd>When you move or resize an object, a little help tag appears to let you know the object&#8217;s new location and size exactly. That is, unless you find it annoying and turn it off here.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="profeature">
<dd>
(<strong>Pro</strong>) If you have OmniGraffle Pro, a second option is available for displaying any notes and metadata you&#8217;ve assigned to an object when you mouse over them.</dd>
</div>
<div class="profeature">

<dl>
<dt>Object ID Numbers</dt>
<dd>(<strong>Pro</strong>) If you&#8217;re accessing OmniGraffle objects with AppleScript, or you&#8217;re otherwise endeared to unique IDs, you can select Show object identification numbers to add a column to the list sidebar.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Full Screen</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to display the toolbar when in full screen mode.</dd>

<dt>Inspectors</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to hide inspectors that don&#8217;t apply to the currently selected object.</dd>

<dt>Preferences Reset button</dt>
<dd>Each preference pane has a <strong>Reset</strong> button in the lower-left corner. Click this button to return all of the settings on the pane to their defaults. To reset all settings on all preference panes, hold <strong>Option</strong> while clicking Reset.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="drawingtools">Drawing Tools</h3>

<p>The Drawing Tools preferences provides you with another way to organize the tools you see in OmniGraffle&#8217;s toolbar and set their Hot Keys. You can also define how you interact with the tools, and set the behaviors for line creation and editing.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_prefs_drawingtools.png" alt="OmniGraffles Drawing Tools preference pane" id="og61_prefs_drawingtools" style="width:500px;" />
</figure>

<p>You can drag tools around in the list to reorder them in the palette. Move the separator line to change where the expansion button appears in the toolbar; move it to the end of the list to get rid of the button entirely. </p>

<p>Double-click a tool&#8217;s hot key to change it. A hot key activates a tool for only as long as you hold the key down; once you release the key, the previously active tool becomes active again.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Keep tool active</dt>
<dd>By default, it takes one click to temporarily activate a tool, and two clicks to make a tool &#8220;stick&#8221; in an active state. You can choose to make tools stick after only one click, or make it so that every tool selection is temporary.</dd>

<dt>Line Creation</dt>
<dd>When you are creating a line, clicking an object will always connect the line to the object and end the line. If you click in an empty area of the canvas, though, you might want to end the line there or you might want just to add a point there and continue creating the line. Use this preference setting to indicate which you prefer.</dd>

<dt>Line Editing</dt>
<dd>When you double-click a line, you might prefer to add a new point to the line, or you might prefer to add a label. Choose one; <strong>Option-double-click</strong> performs the opposite action.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="profeature">

<h3 id="presentationpreferences">Presentation Preferences (<strong>Pro</strong>)</h3>

<p>For those times when you need to make a presentation, say to show off the new user interface for an app you&#8217;re developing or when you&#8217;re showing a client how you plan to redesign their home, OmniGraffle Pro offers Presentation mode. Available by choosing <strong>View &#x25b8; Start Presentation</strong>, OmniGraffle takes over your entire screen so you can easily show off your work to everyone in the room.</p>

<p>Use the Presentation preferences to configure your settings for making presentations.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_prefs_presentation.png" alt="OmniGraffles Presentation preference pane" id="og61_prefs_presentation" style="width:500px;" />
</figure>

<dl>
<dt>Highlight Behavior</dt>
<dd>Choose whether to have an object become highlighted whenever you put the pointer on it, whenever you click it, or never. You can also choose to display a badge for objects that have actions set up in the Action inspector.</dd>

<dt>Highlight Appearance</dt>
<dd>Click the color well to choose a color for the highlight. Use the slider to adjust the thickness of the highlight.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="tip">
<span class="tip-glyph"></span><strong>Tip</strong><br/>
To always match OS X&#8217;s highlight color (set in <strong>System Preferences &#x25b8; General &#x25b8; Highlight color</strong>), open the Colors palette and select the third button, <strong>Color Palettes</strong> in the window&#8217;s toolbar. In the <strong>Palette</strong> pop-up, choose <strong>Developer</strong> and then scroll down and choose <strong>selectedControlColor</strong> from the list of options.</p>
</div>

<p>Each canvas acts as a slide; use the arrow keys to move between canvases. You can also press Return or Enter, or click, to move to the next canvas. If your Presentation preferences are set to highlight an object when you click it, doing so won&#8217;t advance to the next canvas; you can still click an empty area of the canvas to advance.</p>

<p>While in Presentation mode, you can get to the menu bar by moving your mouse to the top of the screen. The menu bar goes back into hiding when you move the mouse away. If you move the mouse to the bottom of the screen, a navigation interface appears, with buttons for going forward or back, exiting, or moving directly to a particular canvas.</p>

<div class="tip">
<span class="tip-glyph"></span><strong>Tip</strong><br/>
To turn presentation mode on and off quickly, use <strong>Option-Command-P</strong>. To leave presentation mode, press <strong>Escape</strong> or click the <strong>&#215;</strong> button that appears when you move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.</p>
</div>

<p>You can highlight objects to draw attention to them during the presentation. Use the Presentation preferences to control how highlighting happens.</p>

<p>Actions set up in the Action inspector work while in presentation mode. When you click an object that has an action assigned, it performs the action as if you had clicked it with the Browse tool.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="updatepreferences">Update Preferences</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve purchased your copy of OmniGraffle 6 (Pro or Standard) from The Omni Group&#8217;s website, OmniGraffle can automatically use your Internet connection to check for new and updated versions.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-glyph"></span><strong>Note</strong><br/>
The Update Preferences panel doesn&#8217;t exist if you have purchased OmniGraffle 6 from the Mac App Store. When there&#8217;s a new version of OmniGraffle 6 available, the Mac App Store will alert you to download and install that on your Mac.</p>
</div>

<p>You can specify whether OmniGraffle will automatically check for updates Daily, Weekly, or Monthly, or if you&#8217;re really impatient, you can click <strong>Check for Updates Now</strong> to see if we&#8217;ve issued a new release. This is particularly helpful if you have <strong>Check for updates</strong> set to check Monthly and you&#8217;ve recently heard that a new update is available.</p>

<figure>
<img src="HelpImages/og61_prefs_update.png" alt="OmniGraffles Update preferences" id="og61_prefs_update" style="width:500px;" />
</figure>

<p>If <strong>Check for updates</strong> is turned on, you will be notified when there is a new version of OmniGraffle ready for you to download and enjoy. Click <strong>Check for Updates Now</strong> to look for the newest version manually; you can also choose <strong>OmniGraffle &#x25b8; Check for Updates</strong> from the menu bar.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can opt in to <strong>Include system information</strong> when OmniGraffle checks for updates. This sends basic information about your system to us, which we <em>only</em> use to better support various systems with future releases of OmniGraffle. And, as the Update preferences pane says: <em>&#8220;This information is kept entirely anonymous,&#8221;</em> which means that the information we receive about your system stays with us and is only used by us as we work on future updates of OmniGraffle.</p>
